INTRODUCTION
------------
This module will provide a UI to display all libraries provide by modules and themes.
Once libraries_ui is been installed visit /admin/config/media/libraries_ui to get all
libraries information. For site builder, this is perfect to find out about your libraries
in your website. For developers, this module contains a very light-weight method that
allows you to get all the information about libraries in an array. This can be very
helpful if you need to use the libraries data for other modules.

INSTALLATION
------------
Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
for further information.
